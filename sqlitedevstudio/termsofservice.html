        </div>
        <p>
            You should know and understand your rights and our rights relating to the provision 
            of services when installing SQLiteDevStudio. Please review them carefully. By installing 
            the application you agree to these Terms and any supplemental terms which we make 
            available to you on the services which shall form part of the terms.
        </p>
        <h2>Registration and Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age 
            required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a 
            binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian 
            has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the services you must create a user account on first launch. Only one account 
            can be created per installation. All that is required is an email address and a 
            password of your choice. The email address is used solely for password recovery. See 
            our Privacy Policy for how personal information gathered is used. You are solely 
            responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your 
            account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device 
            while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur 
            under your account or from your computer and mobile devices. We endeavor to use reasonable 
            security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, 
            however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your content or the personal 
            information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent 
            third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree 
            to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, or any other breach 
            of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to data 
            and any other information or content you provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            ou may assign your Google account to SQLiteDevStudio to retrieve your user account 
            password. If you connect your account to your Google account the Google mail API will 
            be used to send your SQLiteDevStudio account password via the email you provided when 
            creating the account. By using the Google Mail API in this way you hereby agree to be 
            bound by the Google APIs Terms of Service (including the Google privacy Policy) in 
            connection with your use of such services. As is your right you may revoke your 
            SQLiteDevStudio account from your Google account at any time from within the app.
        </p>
        <h2>

        <p>
            In order to access certain functionality of the Services, you will be required to pay 
            a one-time fee. By purchasing a Premium account via In-App Google Play Billing you 
            agree to pay the one-time fee, and other charges you incur in connection with your 
            account. We reserve the right to increase the fee, any associated taxes, or to 
            institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice. Changes in the Premium 
            Services fee would not affect users who had already made a purchase.
        </p>

                database can then be restored to original location. This means changes made can be 
                seen by any other third-party app that may use the database.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Selecting records to update or delete through a user interface is not available on 
                devices running SQLite versions lower than 3.16.0.</li>

            cancellation. We strongly recommend to trial the free version of the app (with reduced 
            services) before purchasing the Premium version.
        </p>

        <h2>WARNING Data Integrity & Liability</h2>
        <p>
            Manual manipulation of data and objects within a database can lead to a loss or corruption 
            of that data and/or objects. This may result in unintended/undesirable consequences for 
            the app which the database is associated with. SQLiteDevStudio is a tool for manually 
            creating, editing and deleting databases, associated data, and database objects. By 
            using the services within SQLiteDevStudio the user accepts full responsibility for any 
            database loss or corruption.
