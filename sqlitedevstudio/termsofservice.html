    <p>
      You should know and understand your rights and our rights relating to the provision
      of services when installing SQLiteDevStudio. Please review them carefully. By installing
      the application you agree to these Terms and any supplemental terms which we make
      available to you on the services which shall form part of the terms.
    </p>
    <h2>Registration and Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age
      required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a
      binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian
      has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the services you must create a user account on first launch. Only one account
      can be created per installation. All that is required is an email address and a
      password of your choice. The email address is used solely for password recovery. See
      our Privacy Policy for how personal information gathered is used. You are solely
      responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your
      account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device
      while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur
      under your account or from your computer and mobile devices. We endeavor to use reasonable
      security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot,
      however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your content or the personal
      information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent
      third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree
      to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, or any other breach
      of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to data
      and any other information or content you provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      ou may assign your Google account to SQLiteDevStudio to retrieve your user account
      password. If you connect your account to your Google account the Google mail API will
      be used to send your SQLiteDevStudio account password via the email you provided when
      creating the account. By using the Google Mail API in this way you hereby agree to be
      bound by the Google APIs Terms of Service (including the Google privacy Policy) in
      connection with your use of such services. As is your right you may revoke your
      SQLiteDevStudio account from your Google account at any time from within the app.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Payments
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to access certain functionality of the Services, you will be required to pay
      a one-time fee. By purchasing a Premium account via In-App Google Play Billing you
      agree to pay the one-time fee, and other charges you incur in connection with your
      account. We reserve the right to increase the fee, any associated taxes, or to
      institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice. Changes in the Premium
      Services fee would not affect users who had already made a purchase.

    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>WARNING Data Integrity & Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Manual manipulation of data and objects within a database can lead to a loss or corruption

      the app which the database is associated with. SQLiteDevStudio is a tool for manually
      creating, editing and deleting databases, associated data, and database objects. By
      using the services within SQLiteDevStudio the user accepts full responsibility for any
      database loss or corruption.

      or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any portion thereof with or
