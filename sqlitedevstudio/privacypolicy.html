    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this
      privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.
    </p>
    <h2>Collection of Routine Information</h2>
    <p>
      SQLiteDevStudio only collects user information when a user account is initially
      created to access the app. The only piece of information required is the user's
      email address. This is not distributed to any other party. It is only stored
      locally on the device which has had SQLiteDevStudio installed and in an encrypted
      format. Gathering the email address is for the sole purpose of password recovery.
    </p>
    <h2>Billing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect and/or store your billing information. In-app purchases are performed
      by Google Play. For their payment terms and conditions please see the Google Play
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h2>In-App Purchase</h2>
    <p>
      SQLiteDevStudio is free to download, however, functionality is restricted in the free
      version (unless installed during the initial trial period which unlocks all functionality
      for free). An in-app purchase can be made to unlock the premium functionality. This is a
      one time only payment which will perpetuate for the lifespan of the application.
    </p>
    <h2>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>
    <p>
      This application does not collect any information about the location of your mobile device.
    </p>
    <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
    <p>
      You can remove the stored encrypted email address collected when the user account was
      created by simply unistalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall processes
      as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace.
    </p>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use the application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children. If a
      parent or guardian becomes aware that his/her child has provided an email address to our
      app that they did not approve then they should take steps to remove the app from the device.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      SQLiteDevStudio does not use cookies in anyway to store information about a user's
      preferences and history.
    </p>
    <h2>Advertisement and Other Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      This app has no advertisement partners or connection to other third parties. As such there
      is no issue of a user's activities being tracked for the purpose of targetted advertisements
      or the gathering of personal information.
    </p>
    <h2>Links to Third Party Websites</h2>
    <p>
      We have included links to websites on this app for attributation purposes only. We are
      not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that
      the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method
      of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While
      we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
      cannot guarantee it's absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is effective as of 20th October 2021 and will remain in effect except
      with respect to any changes in it's provisions in the future, which will be in effect
      immediately after being posted on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check
      this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy,
      we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our app.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Application, you are consenting to our gathering of your information as set
      forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Gathering" means the manual input
      of information by the user and the storage of it in the app itself. No user information is
      passed out of the app to other parties at any time. All user information can be deleted by
      unistalling the app.
    </p>
    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
